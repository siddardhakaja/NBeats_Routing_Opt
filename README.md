# NBeats_Routing_Opt

The objective of this project is to predict the next transmission through a router or switch in a network.

## Data Collection
The data is collected and cleaned by me. A router in Telia network is observed for 24 hours and an univariate dataset is created. 

## Model Prepperation

Model is a dual stacked ResNet that observes the trend and seasonality of the data to predict the next coming values.
